# Homework 1:
## Acceptance Criteria
__GIVEN__ that an employer or client wants to hire a developer
__WHEN__ viewing their portfolio
__THEN__ they are able to learn about the developer, find contact information, and follow links to projects and repositories

## Instructions ##
* Create a new GitHub repository, initialize it with a README.md , and clone it to your local development environment.
* Follow best practices for your README as outlined in the Good-README-Guide
Inside the repo folder on your computer, create the following:
  * 3 HTML documents:  
    * index.html, 
    * contact.html
    * portfolio.html.
  * A folder called assets.
Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: 
    * css 
    * images.

In the css folder, make a file called style.css.

In the images folder, save the images you plan on 
using (like your profile image and the placeholder images for the portfolio).

When you create a website, it’s standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS and to complete one HTML file before moving onto the next. Write your HTML semantically too:
If something is a heading, use a heading element.
If something is a list, use an unordered or ordered list element.
The content in index.html should be unique to you in the following ways:
Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun; show your personality!
The main logo where it says “Your Name” should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name is—that is fine and expected.
After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the style.css file you created.
Be sure to validate your html.
Consult the following Style Guide section for advice on styling your CSS files.
Refer to the attached images
IMPORTANT Your site’s layout must match the designs in these screenshots.
Style Guide:
Colors (Pro Tip: Use the Eye Dropper Chrome extension to find the colors that are used on webpages.)
Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): #4aaaa5
Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): #777777
Main header background color: #ffffff
Main header border color: #cccccc
Footer background color: #666666
Main content background color: #ffffff
Main content border color: #dddddd
Fonts:
For heading fonts use font-family: ‘Georgia’, Times, ‘Times New Roman’, serif;
For all other fonts use ‘Arial’, ‘Helvetica Neue’, Helvetica, sans-serif;
Profile image in index.html:
Use a picture of yourself.
Portfolio images:
Save the images to your images folder.
Background images:
The background pattern used was found on Subtle Patterns. You can browse through that site and use whichever pattern you like.
Dimensions:
The entire content and the main section content area is 960px wide.
Recommended Dimensions
Make a “sticky footer.” You will notice that the dark gray footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn’t much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:
Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. Refer to this sticky footer tutorial for guidance.
Give the footer the following CSS: border-top: 8px solid #4aaaa5;
Look into these concepts: float, padding, margin, display, overflow, clear and text-align.
